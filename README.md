Title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Based on Value Functions: A Comparative Study of DQN and RIAL Algorithms in Cooperative Material Handling Tasks.

Environmental Settings:
DQN: Use the PettingZoo platform for direct training
RIAL: Utilize the PettingZoo platform + write our own RIALAgent class, customize the network structure, design communication channels, and write your own training loop

Add evaluation indicators of different dimensions:
Performance category: Average reward, success rate, steps
Learning category: Convergence speed, convergence stability
Behavioral categories: collaboration rate, collision rate, route length
Communication category: Message frequency, entropy, similarity
Methods :(t-test,ANOVA,boxplot+IQR,pearson,spearman,KL divergence)
